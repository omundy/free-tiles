## Usage
The basemaps can be changed with the select box, or the next/previous buttons on the navbar. The green + icon can be used to
add a single overlay to the map.

The Info button provides the endpoints for the basemap/overlay, as well as links to launch a demo of the map in Codepen or 
JsFiddle
